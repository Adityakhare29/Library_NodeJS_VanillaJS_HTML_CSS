# Library_NodeJS_VanillaJS_HTML_CSS
this project based on Node server, vanilla JS, HTML and CSS
In node server I created different APIs to new book details, get all the books stored in library, search books by author and search books by Id

yes you think how a person can search book by id actually it is more like a self book stall in which you add your own books one by one hence you know the id of each books

in webpage I created buttons to perform different function and fetch different apis from node server using HTML and vanilla JS, and do styling using CSS3

Keep in mind I didn.t use Core Policy so if you start server in different port and load web app in different then install unblocck cors extension to bypass core policy

and yes suggestion and feed back always welcome
